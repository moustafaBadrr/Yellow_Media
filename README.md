5 - there are some data in the database if you want to use like users and admins
6 - Admins must be marked manually in the database


# Notes

I want to say this app not my best due to some reasons
1 - I have less than 2 hours per day because 8 hours working and 5 hours average may be more in Transportation!
2 - I go home tired from working and Transportation so my power is almost finished! No ideas, no creativity
3 - I have a lot of ideas to handle this task better than what I did.
4 - Finally, i want to take these reason in considration and Thank you for your time and considration!
