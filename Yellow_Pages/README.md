### Hey!!

I hope you are doing well.

## Let's start our journey

### To run this app you have to follow the below steps

#### - Clone the repository from GitHub and open the inner file called "Yellow_Pages" in your editor, not the repository itself due to paths
#### - I attached the Database file so you have to import the database under name "yellow_pages"
#### - I use XAMPP, MySQL, PHP so you have to install all of them!
#### - Put the app in c:\xampp\htdocs
#### - Write in chrome url localhost/Yellow_Pages/ ==>> Sign up opens !
#### - there are some data in the database if you want to use like users and admins
#### - Admins must be marked manually in the database
