## Yellow_Media

Task Provided From Yellow Media

### Hey!!

I hope you are doing well.

## Let's start our journey

### To run this app you have to follow the below steps

#### - Clone the repository from GitHub and open the inner file called "Yellow_Pages" in your editor, not the repository itself due to paths
#### - I attached the Database file so you have to import the database under name "yellow_pages"
#### - I use XAMPP, MySQL, PHP so you have to install all of them!
#### - Put the app in c:\xampp\htdocs
#### - Write in chrome url localhost/Yellow_Pages/ ==>> Sign up opens !
#### - there are some data in the database if you want to use like users and admins
#### - Admins must be marked manually in the database
#### - I'm using CDNs for some libraries

## Notes

### I want to say this app is not my best due to some reasons

#### - I have less than 2 hours per day because 8 hours working and 5 hours average may be more in Transportation!
#### - I go home tired from working and Transportation so my power is almost finished! No ideas, no creativity
#### - I have a lot of ideas to handle this task better than I did.
#### - Finally, I want to consider these reasons, and Thank you for your time and consideration!
